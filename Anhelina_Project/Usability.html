    <h3>If you find an element of your interface requires instructions, then you need to redesign it</h3>
    <span class="byline"> —  Dan Rubin</span>

    <p><span class="first-letter">F</span>aced with the fact that your users are whizling by, there some important
      things you can do to make sure they
      see and understand as much of what they need to know - and what you want them to know - as possible:</p>

    <ul class="redlist">
      <li>Take advantages of conventions </li>
      <li>Create effective visual hierarhies</li>
      <li>Break pages into clearly defined areas</li>
      <li>Make it obvious what is clikable</li>
      <li>Eliminate distractions</li>
      <li>Format content to support scanning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using contrasting colors will help users to understand and differentiate the content you have
      designed. If you are having trouble deciding on an accessible color palette you can visit<a
        href="http://colorsafe.co/" title="Colors Safe"> Color Safe </a> which creates accessible color palettes for
      your site or app based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). </p>
    <p>Whitespace is also an important design aspect because it provides natural breaks and allows the user to
      distinguish
      what goes together.</p>
    <p>A good way to provide visual breaks on a website is by using horizontal lines.</p>

    <h3> Usability Heuristics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visability: </strong> the Website  visibility is supported by highlighting current link on the navigation panel.</li>
      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        <h2>It does not matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is mindless, unabiguous choice
        </h2>
      </blockquote>
      <li><strong>Match between system and the real world: </strong>the buttons clearly correspond to the labelling . User knows exactly where he/she is going.</li>
      <li> <strong>User control and freedom: </strong> control is supported through navigation and button back which
        bring him exactly to the previous link.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency and Standards:</strong> fonts and link format are unified through all the the Website, all
        pages in this website share the same
        navigation bar, footer and hero-part.</li>
      <li><strong>Error privantion: </strong>validators links show mistakes of the code.</li>
      <li><strong>Recognition rather than recall: </strong>the amount of information on every page is balanced, all
        links have the same format.</li>
      <li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design: </strong>the design is clear and Aesthetic. Colour theme, small
        pictures and aesthetic elements are used in a decent way.
      </li>
      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        <h2>Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what`s left. </h2>
      </blockquote>
      <li> <strong>Flexibility and Efficiency of use:</strong>when user click the link to external site the Webpage
        will be opened in the new tab and it is not the case if
        user is navigating on current The Website.</li>
      <li><strong>Help  users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: </strong>the navigation bar and back buttons
        help users to deal with errors.</li>
      <li> <strong>Help and documentation: </strong> page "About" the provides information about website.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What about Accessability ?<br> Isn't it part of usability</h3>
    <p>And it is true. Unless you are going to make a blanket decision that people with disabilities aren`t your
      audience, you really cant`s say that your site is usable unless it is accessible.</p>
